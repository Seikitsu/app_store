CSV Downloader Brick
==================
This brick can be used for downloading CSV files from various sources (at the moment S3 source is supported)

## Description

This part of documentation is covering only the CSV downloader. The overall information about the connectors structure can be found in connectors metadata gem documentation [link](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata_connectors_metadata/tree/bds_implementation).


## Deployment

The deployment on Ruby Executor infrastructure can be done manually or by the Goodot tool.

### Manual deployment

1. Pack the app store folder apps/csv_downloader_brick. The zip should contain only files, not the directory itself.
2. Deploy the ZIP on the gooddata platform by Data Admin Console [link] (https://secure.gooddata.com/admin/disc/)
3. Create the schedule and put mandatory configuration options to schedule parameters. Mandatory parameters are specified in info.json file.
4. Run the schedule

### Gooddot deployment

The deployment configuration for Gooddot could look like this:

    {
      "processes" : [
        {
            "deployment_type": "app_store",
            "app_id": "csv_downloader_brick",
            "process_type": "ruby",
            "name" : "CSV Connector - Goodot",
            "schedules" : [
                {
                  "name" : "Batch A",
                  "when" : "0 2 2 2 *",
                  "params": {
                  "{{bds_params}}": null,
                  "ID":"csv_downloader_2"
                  },
                  "hidden_params" : {
                    "{{bds_secret_params}}" : null,
                    "csv|options|secret_key":"{{customer_secret}}"
                  }
                }

            ]
        }
      ],
     "params": {
        "bds_params":{
            "bds_bucket": "bds_bucket",
            "bds_folder":"bds_folder",
            "bds_access_key":"access_key",
            "account_id":"AccountName",
            "token":"Token"
        },
        "bds_secret_params":{
            "bds_secret_key":"bds_secret_key"
        },
        "customer_secret":"customer_secret"
      }
    }

After running the Gooddot sync command, you only need to run the schedule on platform

## Data source

The data source need to be accessible by the credentials provided to CSV downloader. The data source should contain the following files:

 * Feed file
 * Manifest files
 * Data files

### Feed file

The feed file is providing information about the structure of the provided data files.

The structure of the file should look like this:

 * **file** - name of the entity, to which this row is connected
 * **version** - the version of file to which the row is connected (this is used for further changes of uploaded CSV files). For example that customer wants to add one column to the source CSV file. We know that in version 1.0 the column was not there and in version 1.1 the columns was there. This will allow us to reprocess the historical data without any changes to FEED file
 * **field** - name of the field (column in source file)
 * **type** - the data type of the field (the supported types are stated at the end of this section)
 * **order** - the order in which the fields are ordered in source files

#### Example:

    file|version|field|type|order
    Account |1.0|ID|integer|0
    Account|1.0|Name|string-255|1
    Account|1.0|Attribute1|string-255|2
    Account|1.0|Attrubute2|string-255|3
    Account|1.1|Attribute3|string-255|4
    User|1.0|ID|integer|1
    User|1.0|Name|string-255|2
    User|1.0|Attribute1|string-255|3
    Facts|1.0|ID|integer|1
    Facts|1.0|account_id|integer|2
    Facts|1.0|user_id|integer|3
    Facts|1.0|fact1|decimal-20-5|4
    Facts|1.2|fact2|decimal-20-5|5

### Manifest files

The second file if manifest file. This file will bind the uploaded files to one batch and this batch of files will be processed as one. The manifest file need to follow specific name convention:
manifest-{batch_identification}_{sequence}.{time}

 * **batch_identification** - string which identifies batch. It is possible to group uploaded files to multiple batches (for example when each fie is loaded in different time window). Batch identification can be for example batchA and batchB.
 * **sequence** (optional) - sequence number of manifest files. The files uploaded on to the source need to follow the sequence. In case that sequence is broken, the batch will not be processed and connector will wait till the missing sequence is loaded.
 * **time** - time of manifest creation in format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (for example 20150217104924). The format can be easily change if needed.

The name of the manifest can look like this: **manifest-batchB_1.20150217104924.csv**

The structure of the file should look like this:

 * **file_url** - full path to desired file uploaded on storage
 * **target_ads** - **OBSOLETE**
 * **timestamp** - unix timestamp representing time when file was uploaded on storage
 * **feed** - name of entity, to which the file is connected
 * **feed_version** - the version in FEED file to which the uploaded file is connected ( **only one version of entity can be present in manifest file** - you cannot have Account v1.0 and Account v2.0 in one manifest)
 * **num_rows** **(optional)** - number of rows in uploaded file
 * **md5** - MD5 checksum of uploaded file
 * **export_type** **(optional)** - possible values (inc/full). Default is inc. It marks if the file in manifest is full or increment. It changes how the file is integrated to database.

#### Example:

    file_url|target_ads|timestamp|feed|feed_version|num_rows|md5|export_type
    s3://bucket/folder/account.20111231235959.txt.gz||1325404799|Account|1.0|2|87c6054999cf18ba69568993357e09f9|full
    s3://bucket/folder/user.20111231235959.txt.gz||1325404799|User|1.0|1|8a4c647cd56e77cb37cf0a5566157dc9|full
    s3://bucket/folder/facts.1.20111231235959.txt.gz||1325404799|Facts|1.2|15444|5d0a290ca7fc8d4dc7dd9cdd0dd15f96|inc
    s3://bucket/folder/facts.2.20111231235959.txt.gz||1325404799|Facts|1.2|52755|ba63d9912e49fa4f4b2e0797d3fcfa41|inc

### Data files

The data files will contain data, which the user want to download. The downloader is accepting pure CSV or GZIPed CSV files. Customer need to specify the format of the CSV file in corresponding section of the CSV downloader. How the configuration should look like can be found in configuration section of this document.

## Configuration

This section is containing information about the CSV downloader section of the configuration.json file. It is important to know, that CSV downloader is processing data in batches. One manifest file, mean one batch. If you want to set up the ADS integrator processing data downloader by CSV connector, you need to switch it to the batch mode. The name  of the batch is ID of the connector.

The structure of the configuration file for S3 data source looks like this:

 * **bucket** - name of the S3 bucket
 * **folder** - name of the folder on the data source. In this folder the manifests files need to be present. It is possible to have more tree like structure. The tool will be looking for manifest in whole path after this path.
 * **data_structure_info** - the full path to the FEED file
 * **access_key** - access key to S3 bucket
 * **secret_key** - secret key to S3 bucket (this parameter should be not saved in configuration.json file but provided to execution by Secure Parameter. How to do it can be found in metadata gem documentation)
 * **manifest** - definition of the manifest file ( more info below )
 * **manifest_process_type** (move/history) - if set to move, the manifest file will be moved to processed folder. If set to history, the manifest will stay.
 * **number_of_manifest_in_one_run** - maximum number of manifests which is processed in one run. Default value is 5
 * **delete_data_after_processing** (true/false) - if set to TRUE, the data will be delete from the source, after processing. Default FALSE.
 * **file_structure** - this section of the configuration is dedicated to structure of the file. This hints are need for CSV parsing when loading it to ADS. More information about each of the option can be found in Vertica documentation [link](http://my.vertica.com/docs/6.1.x/HTML/index.htm#1668.htm).
    * **skip_rows** (optional) - number of skipped columns in CSV (used mainly to remove header from CSV file)
    * **column_separator** (optional) - the character which is separating fields in CSV
    * **escape_as** (optional) - specifies the the escaping character
    * **file_format** (optional) - specify format of the file. Empty is pure CSV. In case of GZIP file use GZIP option.
    * **db_parser** (optional) - specify the type of parser used by ADS. Empty is default parser. In case you want to use GDC Parser use gdc option.
    * **enclosed_by** (optional) - specifies the enclosing character

### Manifest option

The manifest option specify how the information about sequence number and time should be parsed from name of the file.

For example the definition for this manifest name: **manifest-batchB_1.20150217104924.csv** will look like this: **manifest-batchB_{sequence}.{time(%Y%m%d%H%M%S)}**

The time format can be changed as desired. The documentation of possible tags can be found in documentation of the strftime function [link](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Time.html#method-i-strftime).
