SailThru Downloader Brick
==================
This brick is based on CSV Downloader Brick - it reads CSV files created by Hadoop process. The main difference compared to CSV downloader is a specific folder structure. Furthermore, it cleans the "batches" folder to enforce ADS integrator to integrate only the latest batch of files (regardless of whether older batches were processed or not).
